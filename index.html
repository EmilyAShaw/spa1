		<h3><strong>Task</strong></h3>
		<p>The task, for which I completed was to go around Wellington city and discover the signs of internet infrastructure in this city. I took photos of what I found (some photo credit is given to Zoe Richards as my phone died so I lost about two weeks worth of photos and had no backup). I did do illustrator drawings of some of the photographs as felt it drew attention to the parts of the images which are the infrastructure - in case someone like me who started off with no idea about this, came across my website.  </p>

		<h3><strong>Findings</strong></h3>
		<p>I found, through my experience of walking through not only the center of town, but places like Newtown and Haitaitai, that there is internet infrastructure everywhere. I actually found it easier to identify and find infrastructure in smaller townships like those, rather than around places you would think they be (such as kelburn campus). I think this is probably due the signs being hidden more in university, and me not being able to find them - rather than Haitaitai having more infrastructure. </p>

				<h3>Chorus box</h3>
				<p>This is a photo of a chorus box, I found a lot of these in newtown. Riddleford street is littered with them, a building which is powered by chorus would aproximatly have two to three of these outside their residence. I would see these walking to work every day, eventually a lot of them were covered in red tape. Still not sure what that was for.</p>

				<p>This is a classic manhole, you can find these often around cuba street. I do not think that this is part of internet infrastructure, however I am not sure. I do think that it is important to showcase some of the other manholes around the central city.</p>

				<h3>Traffic Light box</h3>
				<p>The brand for this is QTC traffic solutions, I can only assume that this is the box that controls the traffic lights. This was found on the corner of manners and willis. On the side of this it has a dial of on, off, and flash. I am not sure if this is considered internet infrastructure, but it is certainly some time of antennas which controls a part of our every day lives, and I felt that was worth an honorable mention.</p>

				<p>This was taken on the corner of Guznee street and Willis street, this is a traffic signal controller, I asume somehow this communicated with the signal box. It could alse be something else, but this is what I assume it is.</p>

			<div class="HVDC Inter Island Link">
				<h3>Example</h3>
				<p>I did not take this photo, but I feel this was an important park of infrastructure to include, as it is the inter island link, which connects the north island and south island internet. This cable is commonly refered to as the 'Cook Strait cable' and is ownded by Transpower New Zealand. "The link starts at the Benmore Hydroelectric Power Station, on the Waitaki River in Canterbury, and travels 534 kilometres (332 mi) on an overhead transmission line through inland Canterbury and Marlborough to Fighting Bay in the Marlborough Sounds. From Fighting Bay, the link travels 40 km via submarine cables across Cook Strait to Oteranga Bay, near Wellington, before travelling the final 37 km on overhead lines to Haywards transmission substation in Lower Hutt." - Wikipedia</p>
